# JavaScript-Password-Generator

### Created a random password generator that allows users to randomize a password based on 5 different prompts.

## Prompts:
- The user first chooses the desire lenght of the password between 8 and 128
- The user will then get prompted whether they want special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.
- Once all prompts have been answered the website will generate the random password for said user
